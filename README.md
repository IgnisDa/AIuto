# AIuto
AIuto is the best app for the users who are looking forward for a single platform with multiple self-aiding features because people can use AIuto rather than using many different apps for every single feature. It enhances the User experience. Our team is also planning for an entertainment tool for relaxation which is lacking in the existing self-help applications. This feature helps them to get out of the boredom and the capriciousness while using the app. And uniquely, the collective tracking of the team activities, chat screen for that team and automatic activity recommendation fabricates an accountable environment for professional events, team projects and many more collaborative activities.
